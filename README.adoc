= Humble dotfiles

Born 2013. Written and cherry-picked with love.

== What's inside

Mostly tmux, vim, git, zsh, urxvt, ruby, js, awesome wm.
Should work in most Linux'es and BSD. Tested on ArchLinux and OpenBSD.

== Installation

    git clone --recursive --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/pirj/dotfiles
    mv dotfiles/.* .
    mv bootstrap.sh .
    rm -rf dotfiles
    ./bootstrap.sh

== Inspiration sources

I use to browse repositories on GH, and check other people's dotfiles. dotshare.it is another interesting source.

== TODO

* explain what works:
** vim
** command line, shell
** ruby workflow
* get rid of bootstrap, mention how to clone with submodules
* vim plugin bootstrap? pathogen?
