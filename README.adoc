== Installation

    git clone --recursive --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/pirj/dotfiles
    mv dotfiles/.* .
    rm -rf dotfiles
    mkdir .tmp

== Inspiration sources

I use to browse repositories on GH, and check other people's dotfiles. dotshare.it is another interesting source.

==

Update package list on ArchLinux:

    pacman -Qqett >! .packages # only those explicitly installed and not required directly by other packages (double t)
    pacman -Qqe >! .packages # only those explicitly installed and not required by other packages

== TODO

* explain what works:
** vim
** command line, shell
** ruby workflow
* vim plugin bootstrap? pathogen?
* how to install all those aur packages, yaourt? how to install yaourt? bsd?
