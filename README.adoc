= Humble dotfiles

Born 2013. Written and cherry-picked with love.

== What's inside

Mostly tmux, vim, git, zsh, urxvt, ruby, js, awesome wm.
Should work in most Linux'es, OSX and BSD. Tested on ArchLinux, OSX 10.11 and OpenBSD.

== Installation

    git clone --recursive --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/pirj/dotfiles
    mv dotfiles/.* .
    rm -rf dotfiles
    mkdir .tmp

Create .zplug/.gitignore with the following (see https://github.com/b4b4r07/zplug/issues/45):

    .cache
    .gitignore
    repos
    zcompdump

== Inspiration sources

I use to browse repositories on GH, and check other people's dotfiles. dotshare.it is another interesting source.

== Packages

=== On ArchLinux (pacman)

Query (-Q) package list without version numbers (-q), only those explicitly installed (-t) and not required directly by other packages (-tt), native (-n) and foreign (-m):

    pacman -Qqettn >! .packages.native
    pacman -Qqettm >! .packages.foreign

Install:

    sudo pacman -S $(< .packages.native )
    aurget -S $(< .packages.foreign )

=== On OSX (homebrew)

Show installed formulae that are not dependencies of another installed formula:

    brew leaves >! .formula

Install:

    brew install $(< .formula )

== TODO

* explain what works:
** vim
** command line, shell
** ruby workflow
* vim plugin bootstrap? pathogen?
* how to install aurget?
* how to install all those aur packages?
* bsd packages?
