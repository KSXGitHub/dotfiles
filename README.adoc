= Humble dotfiles

Born 2013. Written and cherry-picked with love.

== What's inside

Mostly tmux, vim, git, zsh, urxvt, ruby, js, awesome wm.
Should work in most Linux'es and BSD. Tested on ArchLinux and OpenBSD.

== Installation

    git clone --recursive --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/pirj/dotfiles
    mv dotfiles/.* .
    rm -rf dotfiles
    mkdir .tmp

== Inspiration sources

I use to browse repositories on GH, and check other people's dotfiles. dotshare.it is another interesting source.

== Packages

Update package list on ArchLinux, only those explicitly installed and not required directly by other packages (double t), native and foreign to pacman:

    pacman -Qqettn >! .packages.native
    pacman -Qqettm >! .packages.foreign

== TODO

* explain what works:
** vim
** command line, shell
** ruby workflow
* vim plugin bootstrap? pathogen?
* how to install aurget?
* how to install all those aur packages?
* bsd packages?
